//Car vs. Train

//Every day, I commute from my town of Naperville, Illinois all the way to Chicago for work. I want to calculate which method of transportation would be more cost efficient, driving or taking a train over the span of a month.

//Given: The average amount of days I work in a month (23), My car's gas mileage (23 mpg), My car's gas tank capacity (17.1 gallons)

function calcCost(){
	var daysWork = 23
	var carMPG = 23
	var carTank = 17.1
	var carRange = carMPG * carTank
	
//Parameters: Price of gas per gallon (in dollars), Price of round-trip train fair (in dollars).
	var gasMonth = 23
	
	
}
