//A huge trend in the web development field right now is responsive web design. Web sites that adapt responsive web design have web pages that automatically resize its content to be optimally viewed on what ever device you are using. I want to calculate the ratio that the content is being resized to with the desktop version of the website being 1:1.

//Given: Screen size of the device in inches.

var iphone = 4 //This is the size of the iphone screen.
var android = 4.7
var ipad = 9.7
var desktop = 23
