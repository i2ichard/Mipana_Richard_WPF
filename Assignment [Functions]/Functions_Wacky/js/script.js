//Richard Mipana, 10/24/2013, Assignments_[Functions] - Wacky Calculator

//Every November for the past 3 years, a new Call of Duty game has been released. It's quite sad to think how much time I've spent playing these games. To put things into perspective, I want to create a calculator that tells me how many hours I've played and what that hour amount equals to in money, and calories I could be burning from playing basketball instead.

//Givens: hourly wage($13.00), calories burned per hour of playing full court basketball (776)

var hourRate = 13.00
var bballCals = 776

//Parameters: hours per day spent playing Call Of Duty.
