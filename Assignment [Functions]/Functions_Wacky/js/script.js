//Doggie Boot Camp.

//My dog Nigel is fat. I want him to loose 5 pounds but I only have a limited amount of time each day after work that I can walk him. I want to calculate how long it will take for him to lose 5 pounds while doing it in a healthy fashion. I did some research on Google and found that for my dog's weight (77 lbs.), a healthy daily caloric intake is around 1800 calories. I also found that in order to lose a single pound, he'd have to burn 3500 calories.
