//This is a calculator for three real-life examples. The first is a calculator for a PERSONAL day-to-day use. The second is an INDUSTRY-specific calculator; one that can be used for industry related task. The third is a calculator for FUN; something that is wacky and out there.

//Wacky - Since I am a huge fan of basketball and I've always wanted to know how high I need to jump for me to be able to dunk the ball, I'm creating a calculator that tells you the vertical leap you need to reach in order to dunk based on the user input of height.
